# This exaplins how I did things on this single-page site.

## workflow:
1. included compass so I can use the compass reset and font-face

## Using svg 
1. decide to use svg as a background image which do not need to resize it, can just use the backgroud-size to get the correct size.
2. There are enough headings on the page for SEO purposes so do not need to use the logo as an img.
3. For mobile users can prevent them copying the svg, otherwsie when user touch the image it will pop up a dialog box asking if the users what to save the images
4. Created white version and grey version of the log svg files simply chaged the fill color using sublime text
