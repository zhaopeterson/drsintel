Welcome to Agency Inside's Front-End dev challenge!

This is an exercise aimed at exploring your proficiency in building responsive pages with HTML/CSS. Your goal is to take the desktop and mobile psds included in this folder and create a fully responsive page. All repsonsive behavior must be accomplished with only CSS. There is no JS component to this challenge.

An Intel logo svg and the Intel Clear font faces are included as assets. Other than these pieces all visual elements must be taken from the psd files. Although you should try to have the browser draw as many elements as possible.

You must submit this challenge as a github link. In your github repo you must use this directory structure:

/challenge - the original challenge files
/app - your working files
/dist - your production ready page

You may have more folders than these, but you must include those three folders. Use whatever build tools you are comfortable with, if any.
